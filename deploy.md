# Deploy a Microservice to AWS Elastic Container Service: The Harder Way and the Easier Way

A while back I made this [Pizza service ](http://www.streeteye.com/static/Pizza/#) weekend project and I thought I could just press a button in AWS and deploy it in the cloud. It turned out to beâ€¦ more complicated. With the latest version of Docker it's getting easier. Here's the harder (old) way and the easier (new) way. Hopefully in the not too-distant future it will be as simple as saying `docker compose up` without much additional configuration, or just submitting a form pointing to your container repository.

## The harder way

Based on this AWS document: [Tutorial: Creating a Cluster with a Fargate Task Using the Amazon ECS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-cli-tutorial-fargate.html)

1) [Install and configure AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-environment.html)

2) [Install ECS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_CLI_installation.html)

3) Assume IAM task execution role if needed:

- Create the file `task-execution-assume-role.json` (see [example](task-execution-assume-role.json). Update region as necessary.) 

```bash

aws iam --region us-east-1 create-role --role-name ecsTaskExecutionRole --assume-role-policy-document file://task-execution-assume-role.json

```


- Attach role policy:

```bash

aws iam --region us-east-1 attach-role-policy --role-name ecsTaskExecutionRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy

```

4) Configure credentials and default cluster:


```bash
ecs-cli configure profile --access-key <access-key> --secret-key <secret-key> --profile-name pizza-profile
INFO[0000] Saved ECS CLI profile configuration default.

ecs-cli configure --cluster pizza --default-launch-type FARGATE --config-name pizza --region us-east-1
INFO[0000] Saved ECS CLI cluster configuration pizza.

ecs-cli up --cluster-config pizza --ecs-profile pizza-profile
INFO[0000] Created cluster                               cluster=pizza region=us-east-1
INFO[0061] Waiting for your cluster resources to be created...
INFO[0062] Cloudformation stack status                   stackStatus=CREATE_IN_PROGRESS
INFO[0122] Cloudformation stack status                   stackStatus=CREATE_IN_PROGRESS
VPC created: vpc-123456789012e1234
Subnet created: subnet-1234567890abcdef
Subnet created: subnet-fedcba0987654321
Cluster creation succeeded.
```

Note that this doesn't create your own personal cluster but takes advantage of the Fargate container service.

Take note of info on cluster VPC and subnets reported.

Get security group
```bash

aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=vpc-123456789012e1234 --region us-east-1

```
Take note of e.g. `"GroupId": "sg-1111222233334444"`

5) Configure security group to allow inbound on the desired port, using the security group-id reported (and correct port and region):
```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-1111222233334444 --protocol tcp --port 8181 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0 --region us-east-1

```

6) Create container repository 
```bash
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name pizza
aws ecr describe-repositories

```
Take note of repo URI.

7) Push Docker image to ECR (replace with your repo URI, region):
```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login -u AWS --password-stdin 123412341234.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
docker build . -t pizza
docker tag pizza:latest 123412341234.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pizza:latest
docker push 123412341234.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pizza:latest

```

8) Start the container:

- Make docker-compose.yml file (see [example](ecs-docker-compose.yml). Specify correct ECR image and region)
- Make ecs-params.yml file (see [example](ecs-params.yml). Specify correct subnets and security group)

```bash

ecs-cli compose --project-name pizza service up --create-log-groups --cluster-config pizza --ecs-profile pizza-profile

```

This will take a minute and show some log messages.

```bash

INFO[0000] Using ECS task definition                     TaskDefinition="pizza:1"
INFO[0000] Auto-enabling ECS Managed Tags
INFO[0016] (service pizza) has started 1 tasks: (task cc0dce4d34054f63b3c734b7d9071189).  timestamp="2020-08-23 19:11:14 +0000 UTC"
INFO[0066] Service status                                desiredCount=1 runningCount=1 serviceName=pizza
INFO[0066] ECS Service has reached a stable state        desiredCount=1 runningCount=1 serviceName=pizza
INFO[0066] Created an ECS service                        service=pizza taskDefinition="pizza:1"

```

Go to AWS Elastic Container Service console and you should see your cluster running.

9) Get info on your container:
```bash
ecs-cli compose --project-name pizza service ps --cluster-config pizza --ecs-profile pizza-profile
Name                                              State    Ports                        Task          Definition
Healthpizza/0fec210e48734bf1bfca123a88e3a2f1/web  RUNNING  3.237.198.63:8181->8181/tcp  pizza:1       UNKNOWN

```

Note the IP address and port. You should now be able to access the service on IP:port. For pizza try
http://3.237.198.63:8181/query?location=brooklynheights&keyword=pizza
										    

Note the task id and view logs
```bash

ecs-cli logs --task-id 0fec210e48734bf1bfca123a88e3a2f1 --follow --cluster-config pizza --ecs-profile pizza-profile

```

10) Update the docker image
```bash

docker login -u AWS -p $(aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1) 123412341234.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
docker build . -t pizza
docker tag pizza:latest 123412341234.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pizza:latest
docker push 123412341234.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pizza:latest

```

- Go to ECS console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-1
- Click on cluster e.g. pizza
- Click on service checkbox for Pizza
- Choose 'Update' from dropdown
- On next page click 'Force new deployment', and leave other settings the same , and Update Service

11) Shut it down:
```bash

ecs-cli compose --project-name pizza service down --cluster-config pizza --ecs-profile pizza-profile

```

## The easier way

Docker and AWS have been working to integrate and streamline this process. In theory, modulo configuring region and credentials, you should be able to say `docker compose up` and run all the above steps automatically.

#### Prerequisites

1) As of this writing (9/2020) you need the Edge Docker Release ([Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/edge-release-notes/) or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/edge-release-notes/))
		 
2) You need a default VPC in your EC2 region. If you have a newer AWS account this should be set up by default. If you have an ancient AWS account you may need to [convert from EC2-Classic to VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/vpc-migrate.html#convert-ec2-classic-account), or use a new region with no old-style resources.

3) Enable new ARN format: [see here](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east12#/settings).

#### Steps

1) Create a new AWS CLI profile for ECS (access key, secret, region, output format e.g. JSON)
```bash

aws configure --profile ecs

```

2) Create a Docker context for ecs
```bash

docker context create ecs ecs

```

Choose your AWS named profile created above i.e. `ecs`.

Type your region e.g. `us-east-1`

Hit enter a couple of times.

```bash

(base) drucev@MacBook-Pro ~/projects/dockertest/docker-ecs-compose (main*) $ docker context create ecs ecs
? Select AWS Profile ecs
? Region us-east-1
? Enter credentials No
Successfully created ecs context "ecs"

```

Now you can switch between docker profiles with
```bash
		   
docker context use ecs
docker context use default

```

See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/context/ .

3) Build the Docker image similar to above:
```bash
   
docker context use default
docker build . -t pizza
docker tag pizza:latest 123412341234.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pizza:latest

```

4) Push to Elastic Container Repository similar to above
```bash

aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login -u AWS --password-stdin 123412341234.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
aws ecr create-repository --profile ecs --repository-name pizza
docker push 123412341234.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pizza:latest

```

5) Create `docker-compose.yml`. See [new-docker-compose.yml](new-docker-compose.yml), which specifies image: $(FRONTEND_IMG). (or you can hard-code it.) Rename or copy to docker-compose.yml.
```bash

version: "3.8"
services:
  pizza:
    image: ${FRONTEND_IMG}
    ports:
      - "8181:8181"

```

If you previously created the 'pizza' app, go to the ECS console and delete the existing cluster and task. Run the image with:
```bash

docker context use ecs
FRONTEND_IMG=123412341234.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pizza:latest docker compose up

```

This will take a couple of minutes but should run all the steps specified above.

![Image of docker compose up](images/new_docker_compose_up.png)

You can then do 

```bash

docker compose ps
ID                                NAME                REPLICAS            PORTS
pizza-PizzaService-9UKSYVKGPMX8   pizza               1/1                 PizzaLoadBalancer-c4f8d3de53d346be.elb.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:8181->8181/tcp

```

You should be able to connect to your service on the specified port. It may take a minute for DNS to propagate.

You can also do:

```bash

docker compose logs
FRONTEND_IMG=123412341234.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drucev/pizza:latest docker compose convert
docker compose down

```

`docker compose convert` outputs the CloudFormation JSON to run the container in the ECS service, with all the network setup, security group and rules etc.


That's it! Deploying a public container still seems a little rough around the edges but it's getting better.
